# These are the ports on localhost to run the development servers on.
# Note that the frontend server will proxy any API requests to the backend server, which must also
# be running, either locally or remotely (by specifying SERVER_PORT or SERVER_DOMAIN).
# If a domain is provided, it should contain everything before the first slash of the path,
# including the port (unless it is accessible through the default port, i.e. 80 for http or
# 443 for https), e.g. one of:
#   SERVER_DOMAIN=https://heatmapper.charding.dev
#   SERVER_DOMAIN=http://192.168.1.2:345
#
# Alternatively, the backend development server can be accessed directly, and this will serve the
# latest production build of the frontend server (i.e. by running `yarn build` or `./build`).
#
# Note that, if no SERVER_DOMAIN is provided, it will only be possible to log on from a browser on
# the computer that is hosting the development server. If a SERVER_DOMAIN is provided, it must
# match the callback domain specified at https://www.strava.com/settings/api
